DISCLAIMER: This whole posts is about an untested, non-guaranteed method of detecting inefficiencies on the sports betting market. It is considered as an interesting mathematical and programming exercise, and I encourage the reader to view it strictly as it. I do not encourage anybody to use this system with real money, and if you decide to do so, do it at your own risk.
